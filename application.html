                LU decomposition breaks down a square matrix into the product of two triangular matrices:
                a lower triangular matrix (L) and an upper triangular matrix (U). This decomposition is used
                to solve systems of linear equations, calculate matrix inverses, and find determinants.

                Eigenvalue decomposition is a process that breaks down a square matrix into its constituent eigenvalues
                and eigenvectors, essentially representing it in terms of its core components. This decomposition is widely
                used across various fields like machine learning, physics, and data science. It's particularly valuable in
                tasks like dimensionality reduction, where it helps identify the most important features or directions in a
                dataset.

            <p>
                QR decomposition breaks down a matrix into two simpler matrices: an orthogonal matrix (Q) and
                an upper triangular matrix (R). This technique is used in various applications, including solving
                linear systems of equations, finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix, and solving least
                squares problems.

        <div class="content">
            <p>
                Cholesky decomposition is a method in linear algebra that breaks down a positive-definite Hermitian
                matrix into the product of a lower triangular matrix and its conjugate transpose. This process is
                computationally efficient, particularly for solving systems of linear equations and in applications
                involving kernel inversion. It's often used in statistics, machine learning, and other fields where working
                with covariance matrices or similar structures is common.
